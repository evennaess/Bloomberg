                        <p class="intro">For the past few decades there’s been a rough consensus about how to run a modern capitalist economy.
                            Trade should be free. The gold standard is archaic. 
                        </p>

                                Antitrust should protect consumers rather than punish bigness.
                                Tax rates should be (modestly) higher for the rich. Government should run big deficits during recessions to 
                                support growth but get frugal during good times to reduce debt. Republicans and Democrats didn’t agree on everything, 
                                but the economists in their respective brain trusts shared a general understanding of how to build prosperity.

                                That centrist consensus is losing its power. Republicans are being drawn toward the protectionism of President Trump,
                                Democrats toward the socialism of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman congresswoman from New York City.
                                Trust in the establishment is low, leaving people open to alternatives <q class="quotes">whether they come from the Left or the Right,</q>
                                says Patrick Egan, a New York University political scientist. <br/><q class="quotes">People are open to change and new ideas in a pretty

                                This dissatisfaction with the status quo seems surprising on one level. Unemployment is low. If this U.S. economic
                                expansion lasts past its 10th anniversary in June, it will be the longest since records began in 1854. But much of
                                the prosperity has accrued to those at the top. Meanwhile, China is overtaking the U.S., and climate change 
                                threatens the planet.

                               That’s the message from a new breed of policy

                                The movement—labeled the New Brandeis School by its proponents and derided as Hipster Antitrust by its critics—is looking
                                to ditch the Chicago School approach that’s dominated antitrust enforcement since the late 1970s. The Chicago School 
                                hews to what’s known as the consumer-welfare standard, which finds mergers anticompetitive only if they raise prices.

                            <p class="bodytext-spacing">
                                The new model takes its inspiration from Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who emphasized the need to restrain big
                                companies and the concentration of economic power. Lina Khan helped galvanize the movement with a 2017 paper she wrote as 
                                a law student at Yale that made the case that Amazon.com Inc. is a threat to competition, even though it's lowered some 
                                prices for consumers.

                            <p class="bodytext-spacing">
                                The ideas in Khan’s paper aligned with those of economists and lawyers, such as Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor,
                                who’ve been arguing that the current antitrust framework is ill-equipped to deal with today’s technology titans. Among their
                                recommendations is preventing tech platforms from vertically integrating into different lines of business, where they can 
                                potentially favor their own services and harm rivals. In this view, Facebook shouldn’t be allowed to own Instagram.

                                Defenders of the current framework say the New Brandeis School is nothing more than a big-is-bad ethos that would punish 
                                companies for being successful and popular with consumers. Yet it’s hard to ignore the growing body of research documenting
                                the relationship between rising corporate consolidation and worrying economic trends, including a drop in the number of 
                                startups and tepid wage growth.

                                One sign of the movement’s increasing influence is that Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, one of the 
                                country’s two antitrust watchdogs, has organized hearings on the new enforcement approach. Also, Democratic presidential 
                                candidates such as Senator Elizabeth Warren are making antitrust enforcement a central part of their campaigns. <br/>—David McLaughlin

                                The supply-side pitch is that reducing taxes on companies and top-earning individuals, curtailing spending on welfare programs,
                                and slashing regulation spurs business investment. This leads to faster economic growth that benefits all Americans. Even the 
                                cast of characters is familiar. President Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, promoted a similar agenda as an official 
                                in the Reagan White House.

                                The first piece of the formula is already in place: A Republican-controlled Congress approved tax cuts at the end of Trump’s 
                                first year in office. (The jury is still out on whether those have permanently lifted the U.S. economy onto a higher growth 
                                track, as proponents argued.) The other piece—reducing future obligations of major entitlement programs—will be difficult to 
                                pull off now that Democrats control the House of Representatives and the political winds blow in the direction of a more 
                                relaxed attitude toward government budget deficits.

                                Still, it’s seen as a key ingredient. In a 2017 white paper, John Cogan, Glenn Hubbard, John Taylor, and Kevin Warsh—all pillars
                                of Republican establishment economic policy circles—argued that <q class="quotes">without significant spending restraint, even with positive 
                                effects on economic growth, the tax rate reductions would likely be limited and temporary, limiting their economic benefits.</q>

                                The contention is that spending on welfare eventually will account for an ever-growing share of the economy, “crowding out” 
                                private-sector investment and weighing on growth. This view is still widely held among Washington policymakers. At a Jan. 
                                30 press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, <br/><q class="quotes">It is a long-known fact that the U.S. federal government

                                 Germany offers 
                                a model of how corporate governance could be revamped to give American workers a bigger say over what happens to company profits. 
                                A law that took effect in 1976 formalized what had been common practice at many German companies as far back as the 1920s. It dictates 
                                that in a corporation with more than 500 employees, a third of supervisory board seats must be filled by directors elected by workers, 
                                a share that rises to one-half for companies with more than 2,000 employees.

                                The German system, known as co-determination, allows employees to have a say in working conditions, such as contractual terms and pay.
                                It also gives them a voice in how profits are deployed—say, for a new research and development center vs. more dividends for shareholders. 
                                Some researchers say co-determination has helped spur productivity and innovation at German companies.

                                At the root of co-determination is the idea that companies should balance the interests of their various stakeholders, a group that includes 
                                equity owners but also workers, customers, and even local communities. That was also the ideal in the U.S. until the early 1980s, when under 
                                the influence of economist Milton Friedman it was supplanted by the belief that corporate managers’ sole responsibility is to maximize 
                                returns for shareholders. That single-minded devotion to stockholders has been cited as a factor in the stagnation of U.S. wages.

                                In August, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren unveiled her Accountable Capitalism Act, which draws from the German experience.
                                The plan would allocate a minimum of 40 percent of a company’s board seats to directors representing workers. The requirement would apply to
                                U.S.-domiciled corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Warren’s proposal is designed as a corrective to a trend that has 
                                been drawing increased scrutiny of late: Publicly traded companies in the U.S. have been devoting more and more of their profits to share 
                                buybacks and dividends. Given that less than half of U.S. households own stocks, the chances that workers will benefit when their employer 
                                succeeds improve markedly when profits are plowed back into the company. <br/>—Carolynn Look

                            economic thought says that’s all wrong.

                                Modern Monetary Theory, a once-fringe set of ideas now getting some mainstream attention, says governments borrowing in their own currency 
                                have more room to spend than they think. The U.S., for example, can run deficits without having to worry about going bust, because it creates 
                                the dollars in the first place. The real constraint only kicks in when there’s too much spending relative to a limited supply of goods and 
                                services—in other words, when inflation spikes. And there’s been little sign of that in America for decades.

                                MMTers argue that their system isn’t so radical; it’s the way things already work, at least some of the time. Presidents, including the 
                                current one, haven’t balked at measures to boost the military or cut taxes, even when the resulting deficits run into the hundreds of billions. 
                                And emergencies, such as the 2008 financial meltdown, typically push concerns about balanced budgets deep into the background. Now there’s 
                                a different sort of emergency on the horizon: climate change. Since the threat is arguably greater than economic depression or even war, 
                                it requires action on a suitably vast scale, argue Democrats who’ve picked up on the issue.

                                And MMT offers a key to unlock the financing. That’s why freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the first U.S. politicians to 
                                talk publicly about MMT, is also at the forefront of the drive for a Green New Deal. The maximal version of that program includes shifting the 
                                U.S. to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years. If that wasn’t ambitious enough, the plan also calls for the government to guarantee a job 
                                for everyone who wants one—an MMT favorite that’s also a throwback to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.

                                MMT’s detractors say government spending on that scale could trigger the kind of inflation that would wreck the whole economy. America’s national 
                                debt has already ballooned since the Great Recession, they warn, and adding more will erode the country’s creditworthiness and undermine the 
                                dollar’s role in global finance.

                                While those warnings are still frequently heard, there are signs that they’re losing their impact as the debate leans left. Several renowned 
                                economists who aren’t MMTers have recently tried to downplay the risks attached to deficits and debt. They include Olivier Blanchard, former chief 
                                economist at the International Monetary Fund, and Obama administration heavyweights Larry Summers and Jason Furman. Bank of England chief 
                                Mark Carney has made the case that action on climate change represents an economic opportunity, not a burden.

                                Ocasio-Cortez didn’t manage to garner enough Democratic support for her first attempt at actual legislation, a proposal to set up a Green New Deal

                                on the fringes of mainstream economics who claim an intellectual history going back to Alexander Hamilton and his “Report on Manufactures” to justify the

                                The Washington-based CPA has close ties to the administration. Its chairman, Dan DiMicco, is a former Nucor Corp. chief executive and was a vocal advocate 
                                for the steel tariffs Trump introduced in 2018. He also led the transition team that picked Robert Lighthizer for the job of trade czar.
                                he Trump tariffs have so far hit more than $300 billion in U.S. imports from around the world. And there may be more to come, with the U.S. Department of 
                                Commerce now finalizing an investigation into possible auto duties.

                                Many dispute those numbers. They also argue the tariffs will lead to longer-term economic harm by reducing the attraction of the U.S. as a location for 
                                export-oriented plants. Volvo Cars, for example, has scrapped plans to expand a South Carolina plant to ship cars to China. General Motors Co., meanwhile,
